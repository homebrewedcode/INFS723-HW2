STEPS:

Make sure Ruby is installed, I used version 2.5.0, though recent ones will likely work

1.  Clone Repository: git clone https://github.com/homebrewedcode/INFS723-HW2.git
2.  Change Directories into cloned folder: cd INFS723-HW2
3.  Install bundler gem: gem install bundler
4.  Run bundler to install dependencies: bundle install
5.  For the Encryption Detection script: ruby detect_decryption.rb
6.  For the decipher encrypted file script: ruby decrypt_file.rb
7.  Open the plain.txt file, this command assuming vim: vim plain.txt
